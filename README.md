# 911 Calls - Capstone Project
This is a project for practicing data analysis using Python. This project is part of a series of practical exercises in the Python for Data Science and Machine Learning Bootcamp course. 

This capstone project consist in data manipulation and visualization using very known python libraries. 

The dataset is from kaggle and you can find it here: [911 Calls Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/mchirico/montcoalert)

## Steps

### Data and Setup
In this part we invoke the libraries we are going to be using:

- Numpy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

### Basic Questions
We inspect basic information from the dataset, and we start answering basic question to understand the numbers behind the interesting fields.

### Creating new features
In this part we build a new feature from an existing one, and we play with time format, converting dates in string into DateTime Objects.

### Visualization
For visualization we use from plots, countplots to heatmap and clustermaps to understand the 911 events.

### Extras
Interesting things related data manipulation in this projects are:

- reset_index() 
- unstack()
